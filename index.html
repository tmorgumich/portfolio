    <h2>Recommendation</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “I am writing this letter to recommend Troy Morgan as a future Leader in your organization. His dedication to perfecting his professional skills accompanied with his ability to operate with little to no supervision, places him ahead of his peers and colleagues. 

During his time at Revivn, Troy was able to quickly learn difficult hardware and software computer issues and worked within a team to overcome challenging technical problems. Troy helped spearhead new ergonomic SOPs that resulted in a 35% increase in operational productivity.

I have no doubt Troy can successfully lead other Team Members as a Supervisor or Manager. He possesses the skills to motivate, coach, and lead a Team to victory. Other colleagues at Revivn would agree with my assessment of Troy's work ethic and would not hesitate to recommend him as well!”
      <br><strong>– Grant Hardy, Senior Operations Leader, Revivn</strong>
